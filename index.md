### Pakistan Sign Language Recognition using Computer Vision

With 5% of any country's population experiencing hearing impairment, there is a crucial need for a national sign language interpreter.

Manually anotated data, extracted keypoints using MediaPipe, and used a LSTM based architecture for building the model.
